Welcome to My Tic-Tac-Toe Project!

Building this project was a significant challenge as a beginner. I had to dedicate many hours to it, but I learned so much throughout the process, which is a positive outcome!

After putting in so much hard work and effort, it was gratifying to see the interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game working properly, just as I wanted. This project marks a major milestone in my development journey, helping me level up my skills, enhance my problem-solving abilities, and celebrate my progress through this hands-on experience.

Now, let's get to the interesting part:

The main idea behind this project was to provide users with an arcade, retro gaming experience. I aimed to make users feel as if they were playing a game from the 80s, even though they are using their computer at home. I tried to incorporate the colors and layout typical of an arcade game setup.

It can also be a way to relive nostalgic memories and preserve a piece of childhood history.

I hope you enjoy it!
